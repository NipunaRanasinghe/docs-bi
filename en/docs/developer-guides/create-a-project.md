# Create a Project

A project in WSO2 Integrator: BI is the foundational workspace where you define, organize, and manage all your integration artifactsâ€”such as services, data mappings, and connections.

Follow the steps below to create your first integration project using WSO2 Integrator: BI.

## Steps to Create an Integration Project

1. **Launch Visual Studio Code** with the WSO2 Integrator: BI extension enabled.
    
    !!! info
        If you have not installed the extension, follow the [Install WSO2 Integrator: BI]({{base_path}}/get-started/install-wso2-integrator-bi/) guide.

2. **Open the BI Extension**
    
    Click the BI icon on the **Activity Bar** of the VS Code editor. This opens the WSO2 Integrator: BI view.

3. **Create a New Integration Project**
    
    Click on **Create New Integration** in the BI view.
    
    <a href="{{base_path}}/assets/img/developer-guides/create-project/create-a-project.png"><img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/developer-guides/create-project/create-a-project.png" alt="Screenshot of the 'Create New Integration' button in the BI extension view" width="80%"></a>

4. **Name and Choose Location for Your Project**
    
    Enter a suitable name for your integration project and select a location to save it.
    
    <a href="{{base_path}}/assets/img/developer-guides/create-project/add-project-name.png"><img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/developer-guides/create-project/add-project-name.png" alt="Screenshot of dialog to enter project name and select location" width="80%"></a>

    _Expected outcome: A new integration project folder is created at your chosen location._

5. **Access the BI Home Page**
    
    Once the project is created, the BI home page will open automatically in VS Code.
    
    <a href="{{base_path}}/assets/img/developer-guides/create-project/bi-view.png"><img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/developer-guides/create-project/bi-view.png" alt="Screenshot of the BI home page in VS Code after project creation" width="80%"></a>

    _Expected outcome: You should see the BI home page, ready for you to start developing integration artifacts._
