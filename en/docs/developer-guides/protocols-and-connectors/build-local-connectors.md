# Build Local Connectors

APIs power many of the digital services we use daily such as notifications, SMS alerts, reminders, and transactions. These services often expose hundreds of operations via their APIs, making manual coding of client logic tedious and error-prone.

To simplify this, BI allows you to generate local connectors automatically from a valid OpenAPI specification. 

Steps to generate a local connector:

1\. Open your BI project and select Add Local Connector from the left-hand panel.

2\. Enter a name for the connector and upload the OpenAPI specification. BI will automatically generate the local connector based on the provided specification.

3\. Once generated, you can seamlessly use the local connector within your BI integration flows.
