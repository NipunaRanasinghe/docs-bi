# Build Custom Connectors

APIs power many of the digital services we use daily such as notifications, SMS alerts, reminders, and transactions. These services often expose hundreds of operations via their APIs, making manual coding of client logic tedious and error-prone.

To simplify this, BI allows you to generate custom connectors automatically from a valid OpenAPI specification. 

## Steps to generate a custom connector

1. **Select Add Custom Connector from the left-hand panel**
